Hi Yashi, this is my note taking app.

Dependencies required to run the app: 


Details about the app:

All crud operations work via postman
Buttons that work are: - Get notes - refreshes the list and displays all existing notes in the form of cards - New notes - brings up a modal window and lets the user create a new note by filling out a form - Delete notes - deletes the note card and updates on screen
stuff that's kinda broken: - update button - will not bring up modal. Could not fix in time unfortunately - creating a new note has a bug - modal window won't disappear on its own. - Authentication unfortunately was not implemented due to time contraints.
I've left the other branches because they contain notes and comments and the authentication feature that works but was not implemented.

Master branch has everything except auth0 or comments Test branch has the auth 0 implemented but does not have most of the UI done. Notes branch - has the same code as master branch but with additional comments.
